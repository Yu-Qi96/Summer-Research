### Abstract ###
Polymers are made up of monomers covalently linked to a chain, similar to beads/pearls on a chain/necklace. Proteins are heteropolymers where monomers — called amino acids — are not identical, unlike homopolymers that have identical monomers. In spite of a long history of studies on linear homopolymers and heteropolymers there has been limited research on the conformation of branched heteropolymers. This research studies the conformational properties of branched heteropolymers. Specifically we explore the selective placement of amino acids on the heteropolymers even when the total number of constituent amino acids are the same. We will present results by using mathematical theory and computer simulations. The ability to tune the conformation of these branched proteins is important in biology with specific application in designing novel biocompatible materials relevant in bio-therapeutics.
