### Abstract ###
Polymers are made up of monomers covalently linked to a chain, similar to beads/pearls on a chain/necklace. Proteins are heteropolymers where monomers — called amino acids — are not identical, unlike homopolymers that have identical monomers. In spite of a long history of studies on linear homopolymers and heteropolymers there has been limited research on the conformation of branched heteropolymers. This research studies the conformational properties of branched heteropolymers. Specifically we explore the selective placement of amino acids on the heteropolymers even when the total number of constituent amino acids are the same. We will present results by using mathematical theory and computer simulations. The ability to tune the conformation of these branched proteins is important in biology with specific application in designing novel biocompatible materials relevant in bio-therapeutics.


### Background ###
* Networks of branched polymers can be useful in biology and biomedicine. For example, in the formation of tissue matrix.
* Different types of network (Fig. 1) determine the physical and/or chemical properties of the material, such as how strong or weak the specific material is.

* In biological systems, networks can be made of proteins
* Proteins are polymers made of building blocks (amino acids)
